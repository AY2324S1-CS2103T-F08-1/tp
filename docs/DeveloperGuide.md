### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-p 1`.
=======

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API
** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API
** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the clinic book data i.e., all `Patient` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
  which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be
  bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API
** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.cc.commons` package.]

## Implementation

### Medical History

User can add a `MedicalHistoryEvent` with the `Date` with format YYYY-MM-DD,
the `MedicalCondition` and the `Treatment` received by the patient.

The `MedicalHistoryEvent` will then be shown as a list of `MedicalHistoryEvent` in the `Patient`'
s `PatientMedicalHistory`.
The MedicalHistory will be facilitated using the FilteredList, although the current implementation does not allow
filtering.

When the user starts an application, there will be an empty `ClinicBookMedicalHistory`. It will be populated when the
user executes `list-medical-history` command.

The `PatientMedicalHistory` for each `Patient` will be stored in clinicbook.json as a nested attribute.

The difference between `PatientMedicalHistory` class and `ClinicBookMedicalHistory` class is
that `PatientMedicalHistory` is a list of
`MedicalHistoryEvent` while `ClinicBookMedicalHistory` is a list of `MedicalHistoryEvent` that is currently being
displayed.

#### An example usage scenario and how the medical history mechanism behaves at each step is shown below.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `ClinicBookMedicalHistory` contains no default list
of `MedicalHistoryEvent`.

Step 2. The user inputs `list-md` to list all diaries. `Ui` passes the input to `Logic`. `Logic` then uses a
few `Parser` classes to extract layers of information out as seen from steps 3 to 5.

Step 3. `Logic` passes the user input to `ClinicBookParser`. `ClinicBookParser` identifies that this is
a `ListMedicalHistoryEventCommand` through the word "list-md". It then creates a `ListMedicalHistoryEventCommandParser`
to parse it into a `ListMedicalHistoryEventCommand` and return.

Step 4. Logic finally gets the `ListMedicalHistoryEventCommand` and execute it. The execution firstly
calls `Model#getFilteredPatientList()` to get the patients that are currently being displayed. It then gets
the `Patient` from the list using the index provided by the user.
It then calls `Model#listMedicalHistoryEvents(Patient patient)` to set `ClinicBookMedicalHistory` as the list
of `MedicalHistoryEvent` that belongs to the patient.
This execution then returns a `CommandResult` to `Ui`, containing the response to the user.

Step 5. UI displays the response in the CommandResult. In addition, UI will change to display the list
of `MedicalHistoryEvent` after model updates `filteredMedicalHistoryEvents`, since `Ui` is constantly listening for the
change in `Model`.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the above mentioned scenario

<img src="images/ListMedicalHistoryEventSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

### Appointment-related features

#### Proposed Implementation

The appointment-related features are facilitated by the `appointment` package. The `appointment` package
includes `AppointmentEvent`, `PatientAppointmentList` and `ClinicBookAppointmentList`.
The `PatientAppointmentList` a an attribute for each `Patient` and stores a list of `AppointmentEvent`.
The `ClinicBookAppointmentList` is a list of `AppointmentEvent` that is used for display purposes.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction between the `Logic` component and the `Model` component when the user
issues the `add-appointment` command.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by the `VersionedClinicBook` class. The `VersionedClinicBook` class
extends `ClinicBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as `clinicBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implementes the following operations:

* `VersionedClinicBook#commit()` â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedClinicBook#undo()` â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedClinicBook#redo()` â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

### \[Proposed\] Pharmacy Integration

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed pharmacy integration is facilitated by the `Pharmacy` class. The `Pharmacy` class extends `ClinicBook` with
a list of `Medicine` and `Prescription` that is stored internally as `medicineList` and `prescriptionList`.
Additionally, it implementes the following operations:

* `Pharmacy#addMedicine()` â€” Adds a `Medicine` to the `medicineList`.
* `Pharmacy#deleteMedicine()` â€” Deletes a `Medicine` from the `medicineList`.
* `Pharmacy#addPrescription()` â€” Adds a `Prescription` to the `prescriptionList`.
* `Pharmacy#deletePrescription()` â€” Deletes a `Prescription` from the `prescriptionList`.
* `Pharmacy#findMedicine()` â€” Finds a `Medicine` from the `medicineList`.
* `Pharmacy#listMedicine()` â€” Lists all `Medicine` from the `medicineList`.
* `Pharmacy#listPrescription()` â€” Lists all `Prescription` from the `prescriptionList`.
* `Pharmacy#updateMedicine()` â€” Updates a `Medicine` from the `medicineList`.
* `Pharmacy#updatePrescription()` â€” Updates a `Prescription` from the `prescriptionList`.

Given below is the UML diagram for the `Pharmacy` class.
